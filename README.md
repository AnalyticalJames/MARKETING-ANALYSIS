Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard (Excel)

Project Overview
This project analyzes marketing campaign performance using Microsoft Excel with a strong focus on Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI) and campaign efficiency. The goal is to evaluate how effectively marketing spend translates into revenue, identify high-performing campaigns, and uncover actionable insights to optimize future marketing decisions.

An interactive Excel dashboard was built to allow stakeholders to explore performance by date, campaign category, and individual campaigns.
Dataset Description
The dataset contains daily marketing performance data where each row represents a single campaign on a specific date. The dataset includes the following information:

- Date of marketing spend  
- Campaign name and campaign ID  
- Campaign category (e.g., Social, Search, Banner, Influencer)  
- Impressions  
- Clicks  
- Leads  
- Orders  
- Marketing budget (spend)  
- Revenue generated  

This structure enables analysis across the full marketing funnel, from impressions to revenue.

The following metrics were calculated and analyzed in the dashboard:

- Total Revenue
- Total Marketing Spend

- Conversion Rate (Click → Lead)
- Conversion Rate (Lead → Order)
- Average Order Value (AOV)
